# CLRS in C++

> Work on implementing all pseudo code in CLRS Third Edition.

## Coding Style

> I believe messy code is costing you.

Therefore, in order to make everyone delighted, I format all the code.

- **C++** codes are formatted by [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) following the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Spaces_vs._Tabs). You can see the configuration [here](https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/master/.clang-format).

## General implementation

Make all code as clean as possible and carefully organize each exercise and problem.
